@Seed - 7 userow(3 teacher and 3 not)
[User]
- when is_teacher=True - teacher retrieves correct teacher profile and null for student
- when is_teacher=False - student retrieves student profile - OK Marshmellow or Own model validation
- check if i can save whole in transacation(profile and user) - withour knowing id of user !? - OK works
(password hashing should be a setter) 

@Question - Not Setting nullable on foreign key - does it cascade ??? is it required ??? how does it works ??? Check by deletein User - TESTED
@Seed - 4 teacher profile - 2 is_ausbildung, 1 ausbilder
[Teacher]
- check if foreign key constraint work - user_id, ausbilder_id - WORKS
- self reference - setting and getting by azubi/ausbilder -  WORKS
- getting lectures/setting lectures and user
- validation - if is_ausbildung=True - ausbilder_id must be set else could be null
- validation - can set ausbilder only when is_ausbildung=True
- validation - can set user only when user.is_teacher = True. W przeciwnym razie error msg.
- check if for example wage is mandatory field
- removing ausbilder should not cascade but set to null

@Seed - 3 student profile
[Student]
- started - setting date - what format?
- validation - can set user only when user.is_teacher = False. W przeciwnym razie error msg.
- age validation - between 15 and 120
- retrieve/assign lectures
- retrieve all grades(can i do that directly on student model) "through" relationshop

@Seed - 3 Lectures - without teacher
[Lecture]
- topic cannot be null
- can lecture be created without teacher_id - should be possible !
- assigning/retrieving teacher
- getting all students/assigning student(possible?)


[LectureStudents]
- assigning students and lectures
- checking if student_id and lecture_id unique constraint works
- on_delete cascade when deleting student or lecture
- final_grade should be nullable

[Grade]
- on delete cascade when deleting lecture_student
- assigning studentlecture
- can i create grade by directly giving student and lecture ? will the validation of lecture_student work?
